TODO:
	 ASAP:
		- Remove stop words when comparing article texts
		- Save estimates to file to get rid of redundant calculations
	Future:
		- Try to make sure text doesn't contain garbage.
		- Fast mode/optimal path mode switch
		- Graph generation (not hard, just not something I wanna do right now)
		- Better path printing (see above)
